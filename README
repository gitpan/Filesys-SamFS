Filesys::SamFS
  Description
    Filesys::SamFS makes the SamFS API available to Perl. SamFS is a HSM
    (Hierarchical Storage Management) Filesystem; it manages files in two
    storage levels - a cache on disks and an archive on removable media like
    magneto-optical disks or tapes.

    SamFS is a product of LSC, Inc. For more information, please refer to

  Prerequisites
    perl 5.005_03  While it is quite possible that this module will work
                   with earlier versions, it has only been tested with this
                   version.

    SamFS          Tested with versions 3.3.0-40, 3.3.1-15, and 3.5.0-28.

  Build/Installation
    Standard build/installation supported by ExtUtils::MakeMaker(3)...

            perl Makefile.PL
            make
            make test
            make install

    Note that the ndevstat() call in the API only works for the superuser.
    Consequently, t/03ndevstat.t will fail unless it is run by root. You can
    do this with this command:

            su root -c '/usr/ccs/bin/make test'
