Revision history for Perl extension Filesys::SamFS.
    * 0.1 2008-01-14 13:21
        Regenerated code for constants with recent h2xs to make it more
        efficient. All new constants in supports include files added. Added
        new macros as well. sam_stat now returns the number of blocks and a
        constant blocksize of 512.

        New versions of stat and lstat: stat_sclars and lstat_scalars. They
        return an array ref pointing to the copy arrays rather than the
        arrays themselves, plus the new members of the structure. Code
        wrapping sam_vsn_stat, sam_segment_vsn_stat, sam_segment_stat,
        sam_segment_lstat, sam_restore_file, sam_restore_copy Much of the
        new code can be switched off by defining OLD_SAMFS.

        NOTE: The behaviour of sam_vsn_stat has been changed. Unless
        compiled with OLD_SAMFS, it returns a reference to one array that
        contains the attributes of the requested copy rather than a list of
        arrays, where the first array contains the attributes. I.e. the
        other arrays have been dropped.
